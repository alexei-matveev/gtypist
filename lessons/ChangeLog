        * lessons/Makefile.am: replaced $(wildcard *.typ) by real
          file names (supported by any variant of `make').

        * cz.typ: includes a new Czech lesson
	from Hynek Hanke <hanke@volny.cz>.
	* Makefile.am: pkgdata_DATA = $(wildcard *.typ)
	This is simpler and doesn't have to change with new lessons.

	* esp.typ: added missing `K' on line 109,
	as suggested by José Pelegrín <josepl@acm.org>.

	* d.typ, r.typ, v.typ, esp.typ: remove more occurrences of "Q:
	Press Y to continue, ..."  following an exercise (because this is
	builtin since 2.4)
	* d.typ, v.typ, r.typ: remove all occurrences of "Q: Press Y to
	cont..." following T: : It doesn't make sense to repeat a T:, the
	standard message "Press Enter to continue." is better
	(the exception is esp.typ, where this is used to navigate through
	multipage T:'s)
	* d.typ: There was this I: command:
I:Juvenile zest for excitement whetted interest in parking by the quay.
	(and a D: command was missing in the paragraph). changed this to
	D:.
	* esp.typ: fix a typo (reported by José Pelegrín <josepl@acm.org>)

2001-09-02  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* ?.typ: adapt lessons to new 2.4 syntax
	* demo.typ: rewrite for 2.4
	* gtypist.typ: now generated in autogen.sh
