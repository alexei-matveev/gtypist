T:			Welcome to lesson Q1.
 :
 :In the Q series of lessons, we will be learning to touch-type on the standard
 :keyboard. I will introduce you to each letter on the keyboard, one at a time.
 :By the time you have completed this series, you will be able to type the entire
 :alphabet, the numbers, and most of the punctuation keys by touch.
 :
 :If you have never taken any lessons in typing before, please be patient. Typing
 :is not difficult but it does take a lot of practice. Avoid the tendency to
 :look down at your fingers while typing. This is a very bad habit and is hard
 :to break later. If you hit the wrong key, I will let you know.  (But, I won't
 :tell anyone else, so don't worry about it.)
 :
 :If you have always used the hunt-and-peck method, you will have an even harder
 :time keeping yourself from looking. Don't be surprised if you find touch
 :typing slower than your old ways. It may be slower when you first start.
 :But, touch typing is far faster once you get the hang of it.
 :
 :If you can already touch type, you should be able to go through these lessons
 :fairly quickly. Or, you may want to go directly to the S series.

#                                                             ../orig/q.typ:42
T:
 :			The HOME Keys.
 :
 :In order to hit the correct keys by touch alone, you must always know where your
 :fingers are. The way to do this is to have a special place for each finger.
 :This key is called the HOME position.
 :
 :Place the first finger of your right hand on the J-key. Now, place your second
 :finger on the K-key, your third finger on the L-key, and your fourth-finger on
 :the ;-key (the one with the : and ; on it).
 :
 :Similarly place the four fingers of your left hand on the F, D, S, and A-keys.
 :Place your right thumb over the SPACE bar. (Henceforth, always hit the SPACE
 :bar with this thumb.) Now, lift all your fingers slightly so that they are
 :poised just over the keys. Each finger should be just barely touching its home
 :key. This is an electronic keyboard and does not take much pressure to ac-
 :cidentally press the key down.
 :
 :Above the D-key is the E-key. Above the K-key is the I-key.  Learn these
 :positions well. Whenever you are about to type a line, look at your fingers and
 :make sure they are in the HOME position. Then don't look at them again.

*:_Q_R_L2
#                                                             ../orig/q.typ:63
T:
 :			DRILL PATTERNS
 :
 :For the rest of this lesson, I will display a line of text in the middle of the
 :screen and instructions at the top of the screen.
 :
 :All you have to do is type in the characters that you see in the middle of
 :the screen. If you hit the correct key, I will not do anything.  If you make
 :a mistake, I will display a large X under the letter that you got wrong and
 :beep the terminal. In either event, just keep going by typing the next letter.
 :
 :When you have finished typing the line, hit the RETURN key. To do this, extend
 :the little finger of your right hand over to the RETURN key. Hit the key and
 :zip the finger back to its home position. Be careful not to let your other
 :fingers move far from their home positions in the process. Also, be careful
 :not to type an extra space at the end of the line.
 :
 :If you made no mistakes on the line, I will display the next drill pattern. If
 :you did make a mistake, I will beep at you and make you do the line again. If 
 :on the second try you made more than two mistakes, I will beep again and make
 :you try again, etc. Don't forget to use your right thumb for the SPACE bar.

 :did the job. It is the end of her car.  She has no use for a

 :
 :    It is hot.  It is too hot for her fur hat, but I can buy
 :a box for it. I am due any day.  I can cut a day if I fly.

 :    How is Dan?  Did he get his job?  Dan had to beg for it
 :if he did. He is big and fat but not bad.  The boy can do
 :it if he can act to fit his age. Ask him not to act as a kid.

S:Dear Tom,
 :
 :    Mr. May has one new car.  It has a low red top.  The top
 :is so low you can not see the sun if you sit in the car. Mr.
 :May has not let his own son use it. I saw his son try to put
 :the top up. I ran and met him.  Why not be men and run the car
 :out? We did.  We set out to run it at six.  We two ran it off
 :to an old lot by the sea.
 :
 :    Did his pa see us?  Yes, sir, who but Pa was at No. Ten
 :as we ran by in the car--and Ma, too. Oh, it was war--his pa
 :had a lot to say. Let me lay out the law to you.  You may not
 :use the car as you did not pay for it. You are not yet a man.
 :Son did not lie nor did he win his way.
 :
 :    How are you all?  Now if you get a new car, let me run it.
 :
 :Yours sincerely,

S:    Is it quite certain that the citizens could continue the
 :old conditions if they voted a straight ticket? If we accept
 :as accurate the picture of recent conditions, we can not crave
 :to continue them. We lack the tact to get the citizens to
 :vote a split ticket. Tax collectors try to collect taxes on
 :vacant lots. A discount for cash increases collections.

 :return to Arizona from next February to November. The reason
 :is an error of the owner of the ranch who will not refund

 :Virginia can remain an afternoon and refrain from a quarrel.

S:    By using the new banks of keys on the new keyboard, you

 :have been based on an exact table of words used. You begin

 :type most of the text on the next bank above and on the bank
 :below. Because of this fact your fingers bound back and

 :The keys are fixed to keep both hands busy and in balance.

 :may weigh 112 pounds; with an extra inch, 115 pounds. Add 3
 :pounds for any inch added. Thus if 5 feet and 4 inches, he
 :may weigh 124. If taller, add 4 pounds for each added inch.
 :If 5 feet and 7 inches, he may weigh 136; if 5 feet and 9
 :inches, 144; if 5 feet and 10 inches, he may weigh 148. Now
 :add 5 pounds for each added inch. Thus to stand 6 feet tall
 :may mean 158 pounds. It is better to be a little over-weight.

T:			Vítejte v lekci T1.
 :
 : V sérii lekcí T se budeme uèit psát na standardní klávesnici.
 : Pøedstavím vám v¹echna písmena. Budu postupovat v¾dy po jednom.
 : A¾ dokonèíte tuto sérii, budete ovládat psaní celé abecedy,
 : v¹ech èísel a vìt¹iny interpunkèních znamének.
 :
 : Pokud jste úplní nováèci a je¹tì jste se nikdy psaní na klávesnici
 : v¹emi deseti prsty neuèili, prosím buïte trpìliví. Psaní není
 : slo¾ité, ale je tøeba hodnì cviku. Prosím vyhnìte se poku¹ení
 : dívat se dolù na prsty, kdy¾ pí¹ete. To je velmi ¹patný zvyk
 : a tì¾ko se ho potom zbavuje. Kdy¾ zmáèknete ¹patnou klávesu,
 : dám vám vìdìt. (Nikomu to ale neøeknu, tak¾e ¾ádný strach.)
 : 
 : Pokud jste byli zvyklí psát metodou ulov-a-klovni, bude pro vás
 : tì¾ké zøíci se dívání. Nebuïte pøekvapení, ¾e vám psaní v¹emi
 : deseti prsty pùjde pomaleji, ne¾ vá¹ starý zpùsob. Asi bude
 : v zaèátcích pomalej¹í. Kdy¾ do toho ale koneènì proniknete, 
 : bude to podstatnì rychlej¹í. U¹etøí vám mnoho èasu.
 :
 : Pokud ji¾ psát v¹emi deseti umíte, projdete lekcemi velmi rychle.
 : Mo¾ná byste mohli spí¹e zkusit rovnou sérii S.

T:
 :			Domovské klávesy
 :
 : Abyste mohli stisknout správnou klávesu, musíte v¾dy vìdìt, kde se
 : pøesnì va¹e prsty nacházejí. To zajistíte tak, ¾e budete mít pro
 : ka¾dý prst speciální místo. Takové klávesy se nazývají ,,základní 
 : pozice.''
 :
 : Polo¾te si pravý ukazováèek na klávesu J. Nyní dejte pravý prostøedníèek
 : na klávesu K, prsteníèek na L a malíèek na ù. 
 :
 : Stejnì tak umístìte i prsty va¹í levé ruky na klávesy F, D, S a A. 
 : Pravý ukazováèek na F, prostøedníèek na D, prsteníèek na S a malíèek
 : na A. Pravý i levý palec si polo¾te na SPACE (dlouhá klávesa) úplnì
 : dole, kterou pí¹eme mezeru. K jejímu stisku budeme v¾dy pou¾ívat
 : prst, který se nám hodí lépe. Nyní v¹echny prsty lehce nadzvednìte,
 : aby se vzná¹ely pøesnì nad klávesami. Ka¾dý prst by se mìl své 
 : domovské klávesy dotýkat jen velmi jemnì. Toto je elektronická
 : klávesnice a k náhodnému stisku klávesy není tøeba moc tlaku.
 : 
 : Dobøe se tuto pozici nauète. Kdykoliv se budete chystat na psaní
 : nové øádky textu, zkontrolujte, zda jsou prsty v základní pozici. 
 : Poté se ji¾ na prsty nekoukejte.

*:_T_R_L2
T:
 :
 : Témìø v¹echny klávesnice mají na klávesách F a J malé výstupky,
 : které vám umo¾ní lehce po hmatu základní pozici poznat.
 :
 : Sna¾te se sedìt v rovnì, hodnì vám to ulehèí psaní. Lokty by mìly 
 : být pokrèené v pravém úhlu a mìly by být minimálnì v úrovni klávesnice.
 : Nikdy ne ní¾e, spí¹e o tro¹ku vý¹e.
 :
 : Zápìstí by mìla být polo¾ena na stole. Nemìla by levitovat ve vzduchu
 : ani viset pøes okraj stolku. Opìt mù¾e pomoci jejich zvý¹ení pomocí
 : speciální podlo¾ky.
 :
 : Dbejte na to, abyste mìli prsty pokrèeny a dotýkali se kláves smìrem
 : zeshora. Oba palce musí stále být na klávese SPACE. Dotýkají se jí 
 : nikoliv bøí¹ky, ale vnìj¹ím bokem prvního èlánku. Prsty v základní
 : øadì musí dopadat na støed kláves.

 :			PROCVIÈOVÁNÍ
 :
 : Po zbytek lekce budu v¾dy na v horní èásti zobrazovat instrukce
 : a pod nimi øádku textu.
 :
 : Vy musíte pouze opsat text, který vidíte. Kdy¾ stisknete správnou
 : klávesu, nebudu dìlat nic. Kdykoliv udìláte chybu, tak pod písmenem,
 : které jste zadali ¹patnì, udìlám velké X a zapípám.
 : Jednodu¹e pokraèujte dal¹ím písmenem. Nesna¾te se opravovat, prostì
 : jdìte dál.
 : 
 : Kdy¾ se dostanete na konec øádky, stisknìte ENTER. To udìláte
 : vychýlením pravého malíèku. Stisknìte klávesu a vra»te malíèek
 : zpìt do pùvodní pozice. Dávejte si pozor, aby se va¹e ostatní prsty
 : nehnuly za základní pozice. Dávejte si také pozor, abyste na konci
 : øádky nedìlali navíc je¹tì mezery.
 : 
 : Kdy¾ neudìláte na øádce ¾ádnou chybu, zobrazím dal¹í øádku k procvièení.
 : Pokud udìláte chybu, pípnu a po stisku klávesy ENTER budete øádku opisovat
 : znovu. Kdy¾ opìt udìláte chyby, opìt pípnu a nechám vás cvièení zopakovat
 : a tak dále. Nezapomeòte psát mezery jedním z palcù.

 : Lekce T2
 :
 : V této lekci si zopakujeme, co jste se ji¾ nauèili, a pøidáme dal¹í 
 : písmena E, G, H a znak teèky. Pokud jste v minulých cvièeních je¹tì
 : stále dìlali chyby, nic se nedìje. Jednou nauèené budete odteï ji¾
 : stále procvièovat.
 :
 : Kdykoliv vychýlíte prst ke stisku nìkteré z tìchto kláves, nezapomeòte
 : jej ihned vrátit zpìt do základní pozice. Napøíklad pro stisk klávesy 
 : H zvednìte pravý ukazováèek a posuòte ho mírnì vlevo. Stisknìte klávesu
 : a okam¾itì jej vra»te zpìt na J. 
 :
 : Kdy¾ se ztratíte a neuvìdomíte si, kde jsou va¹e prsty, zkuste to uhodnout.
 : Nedívejte se! Pomohou vám i výstupky na klávesách J a F. Ujistìte se v¾dy,
 : ¾e ukazováèky cítíte tyto výstupky a ostatní prsty máte v øadì. Opravdu se 
 : nedívejte.
 :
 : Sna¾te se dodat psaní plynulost. Maèkejte klávesy v pravidelných 
 : intervalech. Rychlej¹í prsty budou na pomalej¹í èekat, ale to je
 : v poøádku. V této fázi kurzu není rozhodující rychlost. Nespìchejte
 : a zamìøte se hlavnì na rytmus.

 :a little. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, the
 :old saying goes. Play affords relaxation.  Some people claim
 :their work is so enthralling that they do not need to play.
 :Psychologists say that the stress of modern life demands that
 :all adults have some hobby away from their daily pursuit.

T:			Welcome to the Dvorak Course
 :
 :This course has been planned for beginners as well as experienced typists.
 :If you are a beginner learning to type on the American Simplified Keyboard
 :(the Dvorak keyboard), you will find this keyboard easier to learn than
 :the QWERTY (Sholes) keyboard.
 :
 :This is because the ASK has been scientifically designed to minimize cumulative
 :finger motion while typing English. The ten letters on the Home Row
 :(A, O, E, U, I, D, H, T, N, and S) make up about 70% of all keystrokes.
 :These ten letters alone can form over 3000 words. Needless to say, having
 :these keys in the home row facilitates both speed and accuracy.
 :
 :If you are already an experienced typist on the Sholes keyboard, don't despair:
 :you won't have to unlearn everything you know. Your basic typing dexterity
 :remains with you, regardless of the keyboard layout. Learning the Dvorak
 :keyboard is like learning to "play on a new surface", as a tennis player must
 :learn to adjust to grass court or hard court when she has been accustomed to
 :playing on a clay court.

 :
 :    Yes, I came out of the corn, back to the city, both to
 :draw and to do copy on the new cars. To date I am able to
 :put cash in the bank and bear a bill or two. The new deed
 :has done it.
 :
 :    The city has been busy but cold for two days. Dear baby
 :has been to see her best aunt. A band came by the door.
 :Baby let the bird cage drop down with a blow. The bird died.
 :Boys put its dead body deep in a dark card case. Baby also
 :has a ball and blue book to drop. I put the boat away. Its
 :deck did burn, but I care not as it does not cost a cent.
 :
 :    Come, call on me at the club.
 :
 :Yours sincerely,

S:Dear Bea,
 :
 :    I am glad you feel so for the farm in the East.  Even
 :as a girl of four or five I was ever so glad to find the
 :farm. In my eyes it was all as good as gold.  Even my feet
 :felt good. A girl can gain and grow fast on farm food and
 :the fine free air. Why else did face and form grow full
 :and fair so fast?
 :
 :    On each foot of my farm I felt free from fear.  It
 :gave me my fill of fun. I felt no fear of any fire in the
 :fall. Now the fire is a fact and my farm is gone.  Give me
 :my full life, etc. The game goes on.
 :
 :Yours sincerely,

S:Dear Hal,
 :
 :    Just a line to say I am lost if I cannot fly.  I
 :have to keep on here. I knew it was but a hope last May.
 :It was just my last idea in June. Yet I held my head high
 :and did not lose hope.
 :
 :    Why not fly up in the air a half hour or less and
 :look at my lake and our home on the hill? I left it late
 :last July with one item on my list. Bill gave me half an
 :hour of help. Like the lady of the lake I met the king.
 :Bill was a kind king, too.
 :
 :    To lead off into the air and see all our lake so
 :long and lots of land so low, was to live a high hour. I
 :kept my hand at my ear so as to help hear. In the air my
 :hair was a loss. It did not kill me.  I have to fly to know
 :life can be less hard. I like to hold on and help Bill.  I
 :love to fly.
 :
 :Yours sincerely,

S:Dear Pie,
 :
 :    I open most of my mail and meet the news.  I note that
 :you say Mrs. Page is a mere name but you met the Miss Page.
 :
 :    You must need the car.  Once the pass is open I can move
 :the car over to you. Do you mind if I make it part of a nice
 :plan to meet Miss Page, too? Mrs. Page was only a mile past
 :us. Her son was my age and I made the mile at noon to play a
 :bit. She paid us for milk.  She did not mean much to me, but
 :her son did.
 :
 :    Next we had more fun up the pass near the poor old No.
 :Nine mine. I can mark many a mile we once ran.  I must mail
 :this note or I may miss the post.
 :
 :Yours sincerely,

#                                                            ../orig/m.typ:146

S:Dear Ross,
 :
 :    It is a real rain.  The road is so soft my car can but
 :roll, stop, and roll on. Are you on the ship?  If I get as
 :far as the ship, can we sail in such a rain? If we try to
 :sail, the ship is sure to rock or ride on one side. If I get
 :sick, it is up to you to stay by and show us how to save the
 :ship. Ann has some sort of song to sing in the rain.  She
 :said she sent it to you.
 :
 :    Did you read of our sale?  We set out a big sign.  Now
 :any sort of suit and any size seem to sell. We are not rich
 :but we can soon step out or be sold out, if any such rate is
 :to rule.
 :
 :    Ann has not seen the ship as yet.  Rain or no rain, Ann
 :says to send her out. All the rest of us say the same.  Can
 :you ring me in my room at the shop?
 :
 :Yours sincerely,

 :vised to use up-to-date leads based on studies of standards.
 :By-products of student days, well-bred friends, kindness,
 :self-help, with good grades and degrees, are listed as far-
 :sighted aids. In Dad's old-fashioned address to his co-
 :workers, he said sadly that ideas are missed less than first-
 :class friends and good-natured wishers.

 :that you and I wish to go west for a week or two. Did I
 :tell you what a wind we had? I went to town to vote for the
 :one man whom I want. I took a well-used tire.  When it went
 :down on a bad turn, in the woods, I had to walk. Then the
 :wind more than set in, and I had to wait by a wall. It got
 :our old tree.
 :
 :    I saw two men and set them to work on the car, till
 :they told me it was no use. If I were to turn it in, is it
 :true that you can take your car? I want a wide view and I
 :want to talk with you. Thus I wait upon your word.  Wire
 :yes if you will take this trip.
 :
 :Yours sincerely,

 :from among men of our own class? Close the awful cases you
 :now carry along to court, and begin again.

 :girl has a green dress, on its front a funny glass heart that
 :she gives as a favor. The old folks can drive up early, eat
 :and drink and enjoy it all. We will delay the dance till the
 :girls enter in a dozen files. It would crush me to death if
 :an error were found in the plans. Happy hours on earth are
 :never heavy. Can you doubt that you are going?

 :    I have your two later notes of March 1.  Maybe it is a
 :large order for you to leave for the north in the month of
 :March.
 :
 :    Our place is miles away, but the real issue is that mu-
 :sic means much to us. A night of music, even one piece of
 :music, has often meant more to me than my local paper and all
 :the power I have known. If I can plant a love of music in all
 :parts of this place so that all who hear you sing can learn to
 :love it, it will mean more to me than money.
 :
 :    I never laugh at money, but isn't it plain in these
 :lines that price ought to be the least of all the items? The
 :point is that our plans for your party are more important. If
 :you read our other offer in the light of our love for music,
 :we might not seem so far away.
 :
 :Yours sincerely,

 :busy buying a quota of various useful items to supply your

 :say this unusual survey is monotonous rather than glorious.
 :You should hurry surely to Vancouver for some delicious
 :yuletide fare. It seems only yesterday that I was conscious
 :of being young and vigorous enough to fly my buoyant plane.
 :If you lucky boys are victorious over any unusually furious,
 :dangerous, or anxious double duty on this survey, write a
 :quotable account yourself for the Journal.

 :In order to make a quiet and quick slide down the river, the men
 :seize the boat while the others, who are quite ready to serve the
 :girl, sleep.
 :
 :    It seems the girl has sense, for on a sheet of paper she
 :writes that her stock of gold is within reach from a round stone
 :under the small shade tree. She does not quote the boy, but does
 :refer to the sorry end of his short study, and in her reply to his
 :folks she will state how the gold may still be spent in the right
 :way, which will stamp the story as real.

 :trade the world is one whole, and each part in touch with the

 :her young. She has tried to throw her value into her home, which
 :to her is worth so much. War can not be put under until these
 :women see there is but one world, which truly is their world.

S:Dear Rollin,
 :
 :    I did notice a number of the pretty places I passed in
 :the air nearly two months ago, and I can at length locate
 :the best. If prices remain rather low, I will not return
 :for any person or be prompt at orders. I can play a record
 :or two, and not regret there is no report to be looked at.
 :I want to be myself and regard nature, not people.
 :
 :    To obtain this latter result is the proper reason for
 :making this quiet trip. So far from the public, matter in
 :the papers will be old and market policy of little moment.
 :It will please me to have you with us longer than the others.
 :I was really living for the period when I would be placed with
 :you both. Your mother has a lovely manner. I am glad to
 :oblige so recent a member of our office, too.
 :
 :    This letter is being mailed Monday, and in two days we
 :shall go.
 :
 :Yours sincerely,

#                                                            ../orig/m.typ:438

S:Dear Sylvia,
 :
 :    I wonder if my sister talked to you on Sunday of the
 :thirty things we wanted to do this summer? We were trying
 :all the spring season at school to secure a supply of sim-
 :ple but strong materials for a camp in the valley.
 :
 :    It struck me as we were taking a walk down the street
 :that we would surely be unable to do as we stated unless you
 :took a sudden notion to help. It seemed to me on second
 :thought we should give thanks to you for giving tongue to our
 :wishes last winter, for you turned the folks in our favor.
 :
 :    My sister was saying that girls from twenty states had
 :signed our pledge, so we are united. Though this is off the
 :subject, I saw a pretty yellow and silver dress within a win-
 :dow on Main Street toward our corner. Would you think it
 :suitable for the writer?
 :
 :Sincerely yours,

S:    I acquired a bequest from a quizzical Quaker. How
 :to apply it was a quandary. As a quasi artist, I began in
 :Albuquerque to make a quantity of plaques of chance Indian
 :acquaintances. My masquerade as an artist of quality in
 :that quaint land of quite Spanish art and adobe was adequate
 :and equally unique. Squeezed in quiet, antiquated adobe
 :quarters, I began quickly and without qualms to qualify as
 :an artist. After quarrels and questions over my queer tech-
 :niques, I acquired my quota of opaque plaques.

S:Dear Annabel,
 :
 :    My brother and his college friends in the factory decided to arrange an
 :evening exactly as in the old days. After calling us, they arrived and we
 :carried out the idea. We used an old college catalog and each girl had an
 :old college dress.
 :
 :    Further to advance the evening, my brother advised us of an old address
 :near the freight yard where certain college boys brought this or that article
 :and were allowed a few dollars. As we went in, an old man came a step farther,
 :fell forward and against me. Brother charged him. Will you believe this care-
 :ful account I enclose? Between brother and me lay this old man who did seem
 :dead. I can't express my feeling. His head was covered with marks of blows.
 :
 :    Already we were anxious to go. Yet his safe was open, as if to furnish us
 :the old books with the many expense charges against the college boys. When I
 :looked to see who of our company were in them, I read one balance after another
 :paid from the old country to My Dearest Son. You are correct if you guess we
 :now ran, because we did. What follows? Today's paper doesn't have a line.
 :
 :Yours sincerely,

#                                                            ../orig/m.typ:499

S:Dear Mrs. White,
 :
 :    I have been holding on, but this January I am getting out.
 :My wife herself may have told you of our opening. However, I go
 :at ten o'clock this morning, and your husband is still out. He is
 :to do my general work himself, and may not imagine there is any
 :measure of justice in that. We married men are obliged to do as
 :ordered.
 :
 :    I am leaving a hundred matters.  He has my opinion on each.
 :Tell him the minutes of the last meeting of the members are on my
 :table. Tell him I haven't an invoice, but have instead an October
 :bill, for our new machine parts. He may mention this item to the
 :manager, as he has neither its history nor my letters of inquiry.
 :
 :    I find nothing else to include. We shall miss you greatly,
 :and we shall be looking for you at our new home.
 :
 :Yours sincerely,

S:Dear Patrick,
 :
 :    I realize that this letter I am sending may subject you to some trouble.
 :I am writing tonight without waiting to go through various reports on our
 :present program. If I had thought that you would be willing to give me an
 :extra day, perhaps I would have come myself.
 :
 :    As soon as this letter has reached you, and you have finished reading the
 :several items about which I have written, I hope you can give extra working
 :time to my request for special records. These items will suggest a new plan as
 :I picture it. I shall add them to this note.
 :
 :    It is my purpose to prepare a fast station-to-station service that should
 :be in running order soon. I suppose it could be started next month.  Let me
 :ask, also, whether we could receipt each payment, as we receive it, on a
 :regular form similar to those in the package shipped you Tuesday. I am pleased
 :with your showing. You have been like a soldier on duty in any and all
 :weather. Success is your teacher.
 :
 :With my best regards,

 :finished the addition to your lake house by last December,
 :couldn't you exchange it, as it is, for my mountain home?

S:Dear Nathan,
 :
 :    My last shipment has probably been received, for the purchase was made
 :Thursday. Tomorrow is Saturday, a pleasant day, for I go on my vacation.
 :
 :    Do you remember an original idea you proposed last November relative
 :to planning for some shipping from my property? My neighbor recently
 :called it a plan in a thousand, and we must get together so that I can
 :thank you properly. This is a national as well as personal question,
 :and I am trusting that you will be thinking that it is possible for you to
 :help put it into practice.
 :
 :    If you can possibly separate yourself from teachers and your
 :teaching position sometime soon, plan to get a standard car and
 :whatever else is required for the trip. The car would also be a
 :pleasure after you return to New York. May I persuade you in re-

S:    The JOURNAL learned that the relatives on their arrival in
 :April had already referred the trouble to lawyers. Their early re-
 :turn surprises me. As to the children themselves, the older girls
 :are personally agreeable, slender, and certainly full of zest. They
 :travel yearly and already are familiar with the world. Their father
 :was a quizzical old man who fairly idolized them. His will leaves
 :them very nearly a half-million dollars. Only the earlier, first
 :will is very irregular. I've already quizzed them about the real
 :hazards of quarrels over legal prizes of similar size. From their
 :replies I've realized slowly that the girls are all right. It
 :really amazes me that even persons like ourselves promptly seize
 :upon some hostile relative's version of an earlier will, which
 :should be recognized easily as false.

S:Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
 :I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
 :The evil that men do lives after them;
 :The good is oft interred with their bones;
 :So let it be with Caesar: The noble Brutus
 :Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:
 :If it were so, it was a grievous fault;
 :And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.
 :Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest,--
 :For Brutus is an honourable man;
 :So are they all, all honourable men,--
 :Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
 :He was my friend, faithful and just to me;
 :But Brutus says he was ambitious;
 :And Brutus is an honourable man.

S:I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
 :But here I am to speak what I do know.
 :You all did love him once,--not without cause:
 :What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for him?
 :O judgement, thou art fled to brutish beasts,
 :And men have lost their reason!--Bear with me;
 :My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,
 :And I must pause till it come back to me.

 :			Lekce numerické klávesnice
 :
 :Série lekcí N vás nauèí pracovat s numerickou klávesnicí. 
 :K tomu, abyste mohli kurz absolvovat, nepotøebujete umìt
 :psát deseti prsty na klasické klávesnici. Mù¾ete tedy zaèít 
 :pøímo touto sérií.
 :
 :Kdy¾ zadáváte numerické hodnoty, tak je vìt¹inou dùle¾itìj¹í 
 :pøesnost ne¾ rychlost. Procházejte tìmito lekcemi velmi pomalu.
 :Rychlost se pozdìji dostaví sama.
 :
 :Tak jako na standardní klávesnici musíte zaèínat v základní 
 :pozici. Umístìte první tøi prsty va¹í pravé ruky na klávesy
 :4, 5, 6 (ukazováèek, prostøedníèek, prsteníèek).
 :
 :Palec a vá¹ ¹estý prst jsou volné. Prsty by se mìly pouze lehce
 :vzná¹et nad klávesnicí. Mezerník maèkejte palcem èi jakýmkoliv 
 :jiným prstem levé ruky.

T:                     Nápovìda
 : o Jak program ovládat
 : o Proè mám opaènì Y a Z? Co to je QWERTY?
 : o Jak se s pomocí programu mohu nauèit psát na QWERTZ?
 : o Kam posílat oznámení o chybách
 :
 :Skrz lekce a menu se mù¾ete pohybovat s pou¾itím Fx kláves
 :v horní øadì klávesnice. Pokud se nalézáte uvnitø nìjaké lekce,
 :tak vás stisk F12 pøenese do menu lekce. Zde vás stisk F12
 :pøenese do výbìru sérií lekcí. Pakli¾e zmáèknete F12 ve výbìru 
 :lekcí, opustíte program. Na nìkteré dotazy budete odpovídat ano/ne.
 :V takovém pøípadì stisk Y znamená ano, stisk N znamená ne.
 :
 :Místo Fx kláves (napø. pokud je vá¹ terminál nemá) mù¾ete pou¾ít 
 :i klávesy od 1 do 9 pro F1-F9, 0 pro F10 a klávesu A pro F11
 :stejnì jako S pro F12.
 :
 :Pøíruèku ke gtypistu si mù¾ete zobrazit zadáním
 :,,info gtypist'' èi ,,info (gtypist)'' na va¹em
 :terminálu. Pokud pracujete pod dosem, zobrazte 
 :si soubor gtypist.html.
 :		--Pro dal¹í stranu stisknìte ENTER--
T: 		Proè mám opaènì Y/Z, co je to QWERTY?
 :
 :Èeská klávesnice má bohu¾el jeden obrovský problém a tím je 
 :nestandardní poloha kláves Y a Z. Èasto se mù¾ete setkat 
 :s tím, ¾e klávesa Y v horní øadì bude ve skuteènosti psát
 :písmeno Z a obdobnì klávesa Z v øadì dolní bude psát Y.
 :Takovým klávesnicím se øíká QWERTZ (podle polohy prvních
 :¹esti kláves horní øady).
 : 
 :Jeliko¾ toto zpùsobuje obrovské problémy (zvlá¹» pokud jste
 :nuceni pøepínat mezi èeskou a anglickou klávesnicí), zamìøuje
 :se tento kurz na klávesnici QWERTY tak, jak je mezinárodnì 
 :standardizovaná. Vøele vám doporuèuji nastavit si na svém
 :systému také tuto klávesnici, pokud ji je¹tì nepou¾íváte.
 :Není to ¾ádný problém, prostì hledejte v nastavení klávesnice
 :slovo QWERTY a QWERTZ. Pokud máte QWERTZ, pøepnìte na QWERTY.
 :
 :Pøeji mnoho u¹etøených nervù.
 :		--Pro dal¹í stranu stisknìte ENTER--
T: 		Jak se s pomocí programu nauèit QWERTZ
 :
 :Pùvodní zamìøení tohoto programu vám nebrání nauèit
 :se pracovat s klávesnicí QWERTZ. Mù¾ete pou¾ívat kurzy
 :zamìøené na QWERTY a nesetkáte se s výraznìj¹ím problémem.
 :Pouze pamatujte, ¾e na QWERTZ
 :
 :	Y pí¹eme levým malíèkem vpravo dolù
 : 	Z pí¹eme vychýlením pravého ukazováèku vlevo nahoru
 :
 :Nìkam si to zapi¹te a ignorujte hlá¹ky týkající se tìchto dvou
 :písmen pøímo v lekcích.
 :		--Pro dal¹í stranu stisknìte ENTER--
T:			Pøipomínky, oznámení o chybì
 :
 :Pøipomínky ohlednì èeských lekcí a jejich funkce prosím zasílejte
 :na hanke@volny.cz. S obecnými pøipomínkami o programu 
 :a chybami (pokud jste si jisti, ¾e se nejedná o chybu lekce)
 :se prosím obracejte na bug-gtypist@gnu.org.
 :
 :Na adrese hanke@volny.cz rád uvítám pomoc s lokalizací zbylých
 :lekcí a textù.
