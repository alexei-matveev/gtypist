Version 2.6.1 - August/2002
	- findwords.sh: new script to help with creating lessons.
	See the manual for details.
	- configure: checks for ncurses if curses if not available.
	- built with automake-1.6.3 and gettext-0.11.5.
 
Version 2.6 - April/2002
	- New `typefortune' (perl-)script which creates lessons from `fortune'
	(see the new section "Using typefortune" in the manual).
	- New interface messages and manual in Czech

	and texinfo 4.2, following their latest guidelines.

Version 2.5.1 - February/2002
	- fix a bug in --help output
	- small documentation fixes

Version 2.5 - January/2002
	
	- Allowed the user to skip an exercise or exit the lesson by
	pressing ESC twice (once to restart and then again at the
	beginning of the exercise to skip)
	- Added new switch --no-skip which prohibits the user from skipping
	exercises
	- Removed more occurrences of "Q: Press Y to continue, ..."  following
	an exercise (because this is builtin since 2.4) in d.typ, r.typ, v.typ
	and esp.typ
	- Removed all occurrences of "Q: Press Y to cont..." following T: :
	It doesn't make sense to repeat a T:, the standard message
	"Press Enter to continue." is better (d.typ, v.typ, r.typ)
	(multi-page T:'s are the exception)
	- The last two changes make the lesson-files quite a bit simpler
	- Fixed errors in d.typ and esp.typ (see lessons/ChangeLog)
	- Renamed --wpmode to --word-processor
	- Added interface messages in French (using gtranslator)
	- Spanish interface updated by José Pelegrín <josepl@acm.org>
        - Fixes for undefined symbols errors compiling on Unix systems
        (such as Solaris) when both curses and ncurses are installed.

Version 2.4.1 - November/2001

	- documentation: fix some TODOs, shorten the node-names
	and add descriptions in	menus, remove node "Technical Information"
	and place its children on top-level and small markup changes
	- gtypist-mode.el now works with XEmacs as well (because of this,
	gtypist-mode-goto-label is now bound to C-c M-g)
 
Version 2.4 - September/2001

	- Added Finnish Native Language Support 
	- Changes to the types of exercises: d,D for drills and s,S
	for speed-tests
	- Added commands E: (sets error-max) and F: (sets "on failure" label)
	(currently only used in demo.typ and esp.typ)
	- do_drill, do_speedtest: added "builtin repeat loop"
	- print_help: only break on whitespace in help-strings, use ';'
	to separate words.
	- Allowed translation of the "do you want to repeat?" message
	(which is possible because it is now builtin) and the corresponding
	keys (Y/N)
	- fatal_error: made the output more logical
	- Allowed "give up" (repeat lesson) via ESC (there is no way to
	skip an exercise in 2.4)
	- Added (unsigned char) cast in ADDCH, ADDCH_REV to support
	8bit-characters in exercises
	- Rewrote command-line parsing + use '-' as word-separator in
	long options
	- command_char's are case-sensitive now
	- Ignores trailing whitespace in labels
	- Added new lessons which are converted from ktouch-1.0
	(http://ktouch.sourceforge.net)
	kt*.typ, converted by tools/ktouch2typ.pl and
	tipptrainer-0.3.3
	(http://www.pingos.schulnetz.org/tipptrainer):
	currently only the german lesson, which is in ttde.typ, converted
	by tools/tt2typ.pl.
	- An Emacs-mode for editing gtypist's script-files:
	tools/gtypist-mode.el
	- Improved i18n-support
	- Improved German translation (with help from de@li.org)
        - Minor fixes (build, charset definition)
	- Documentation improvements

Version 2.3.2 - Nov/2000
        - Now this program is part of GNU!  We celebrate with a new
          name: "GNU Typist" (or gtypist) and a new release
	- New documentation in Texinfo format, the man page now is
	  generated automatically with the program help2man
	- Now configure  supports curses  if ncurses is  not available
          (thanks to Caolan McNamara <caolan@csn.ul.ie>)

Version 2.3.1 - Sep/2000
	- Fixed bug with --datadir reported by	stephan.hegel@gmx.de 
          Installation of data by default now in prefix/share/typist
	- Now the keys F1,F2,...,F12 can be "emulated" with
	  1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,A,S and also C-q, C-w, C-r, C-t, C-z, C-u, 
	  C-i, C-o, C-p, C-a, C-s
	- Fixed bug in word processor mode reported by Ben Armstrong,
      	  <synrg@sanctuary.nslug.ns.ca> now  by  default  this mode  is
          off, it  can be  activated with the  option --wpmode  or -w.
          (The option --nowpmode doesn't exist anymore)
	- Better documentation for installing typist with Dvorak keyboards
	  and under DOS without Long File Name Support (tested under DOS 6.22)

Version 2.3 - Ago/2000
	- New lesson in spanish (lessons/esp.typ)
	- NLS (Native Language Support) added (via GNU gettext).
	- Avalaible NLS for Spanish (po/es.po) and German (po/de.po)
	- Ported to Windows/DOS with the DJGPP compiler and PDCURSES library
	- New configuration scheme, using automake and autoconf

	
Version 2.2b:
	- Fixed a bug in exercises, where the typing timer was not started
	  when the exercise begins with space characters and word processing
	  behaviour is enabled.
	- Moved the binary to typist_bin, and created a typist shell script
	  wrapper to try to cope with TYPIST_PATH not set, and the variations
	  in the location of the terminfo database between RedHat 5.2 and
	  other platforms.
	- Again, why not look at 'Jtypist'.

Version 2.2a:
	- Added word processing like behaviour to the exercises, so that
	  multiple spaces combine into one, return moves to the next
	  paragraph, space is accepted at the end of a line, and hyphens
	  at a line's end are skipped.
	- Fixed drills so that delete does not actually insert an error,
	  but is now just ignored.
	- Corrected backspace key detection on RedHat Linux 5.2.
  
Version 2.2:
	- Removed the C++ version of the program.  Apart from my elderly
	  slackware system, this would not really compile anywhere else,
	  and was causing more problems than it was worth.
	- Added the "one-time" 'O' drill command.
	- Added the function key to label binding 'K' command, to allow
	  better menus to be built.
	- Tidied the C program for better error handling.  It's still a
	  bit messy, though.
	- Optimised T/D/O/P commands to avoid "Press return to continue"
	  where they are directly followed by a Q command.
	- Updated typv1tov2 and typcombine to use these new features,
	  and output improved menus that use the function keys for direct
	  access to lessons, and repeat-this-exercise queries.
	- The typist binary is now statically linked for Linux, to try
	  to enhance its portability as a binary.  The build system is
	  now RedHat 5.2, and the program is now an incredible 700kB
	  as a static binary.
	- All of these enhancements got finished up after I had completed
	  the Java version, 'Jtypist'.  If you can, I'd heartily recommend
	  that you use the Java one instead of this package.  It has a
	  far better interface, and lots of extra features that Typist 2.2
	  doesn't have.  You should be able to obtain a copy of it from
	  the same place that you picked up this package from.

Version 2.1a:
	- Whole package GPLified.  Otherwise, no changes.  None.
	  Nothing at all.  Really.
