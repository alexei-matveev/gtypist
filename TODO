THINGS TO DO for GNU Typist

See our latest TODO file at
http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=gtypist.git;a=blob_plain;f=TODO;hb=master

If you are interested in helping for some of the below items, we will
be glad to have you in the development team!

You can contact us by writing to bug-gtypist@gnu.org. Your suggestions
are welcome too!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------


FOR 2.10 RELEASE

* Show correct line numbers when nonexistent label was hit in the M command.

o [Tim] switch to GNU gengetopts for CLI and config file options

- communicate  with the gengetopt developers about i18n.

* disable beginner message when --export is given

* Save 'expert' to config file.
   When ESCAPE is used to dismiss the beginner tutorial dialog, add 'expert'
   option to user config file if ESCAPE is used to exit beginner tutorial.

* BUG(?): Make sure that the numpad's [ENTER] key is accepted in numpad lessons.
   Reported by gherald@myway.com.


SHORT TERM

* switch to a different lesson at runtime.
   This would allow to select a lesson directly in the "more lessons..." view.

* Show the label of the last exercise on exit.
   So that the user can easily return to it using -l. Currently, restarting at
   one of these labels won't set the banner, though.

* Show a warning when caps lock is active

* I'd like an option that only enabled wordwrapping.
   The -w option does enable wordwrapping, but it also changes how paragraph
   breaks and spaces after periods are handled, which I don't want. Requested
   by Adam Olsen <rhamph@d2dc.net>

* Another idea is to generate our lessons files directly in our format from
   spelling dictionaries, as they do in KTouch.

* Reuse lessons from dvorak7min and possibly other typing tutors.

* Improve the French translation of "lesson file"
   which includes both Drills (translated by "Exercice") and Speed tests
   ("Tests de vitesse").

* Make a separate package for lessons
   so that lessons compatible with a given gtypist version can be released
   without having to release the tool again.  This is already done by other
   packages: gimp plug-ins or TeTeX fonts are released separately.

   This is definitely need for this tool, for which tutorial files are at least
   as valuable as the raw program itself.

- Provide a variant of the `n.typ' calculator keypad lesson, in which the `.'
   character is replaced by `,'. Useful for some european keyboards.

* allow strings from a .typ file to be translated (things like "lesson: ")
  
* Mac OS X Package? => there is already macports or similar!

* Test wpemu option in combination with multibyte lessons

MEDIUM TERM

* support multibyte encodings other than UTF8??

* Windows installer, shortcuts for different lessons and manual?

* Abstract gtypist front-ends, so that multiple interfaces can be written.
- move the existing ncurses code to an interface implementation.

* Add new interface: Graphical interface (GTK)
   The benefits we can expect from a GTK interface are:

   - Much attractive than the `ncurses' interface. 
   - Not using `ncurses' should avoid problems supporting different
      terminal types.
   - We could have a graphical control panel, to change settings
      that are so far only available in the command line (keyboard
      type, silent mode...)
   - Easy access to help and manual
   - Could still be compiled on Win32 on which GTK has been ported.

* Add new interface: Audio interface
   Could use a system like Speech Dispatcher to read the lessons for visually
   impaired people or people living in very dense fog.

   We could also support audio typing exercises.  Users would type
   from a text read by a speaker.  Several audio files would be
   need, according to the language and the targeted typing speeded.
   That would be useful for people like secretaries and
   journalists.

   All this could be implemented in a clean way by implementing an
   event based mechanism. The core application could send interface
   messages to a generic interface manager, which could according
   to user settings, ask the graphical, text or audio interface to
   send it to the user.

   Specifications are on going. 

* Save lesson prgress.
   Add support for saving the last lesson (or part of a lesson) the user was
   working on, so the user can easily pick up where s/he left off. (idea by
   Enrique Pedroso)

* Improve the documentation of course files

* Broaden our lesson database:
- Create new lessons for other languages and keyboard types.
- Translate lessons in other languages for languages that share the same
   keyboard, you can reuse instructions and drills)
- We can also look for teachers who are ready to contribute lessons or let us
   reuse theirs...
- Reuse lessons from old typing teaching books which copyrights have expired
   (how much time does it take?).
- This will most likely require UTF-8 support

* Better typing statistics.
   Speed and accuracy for individual keys, and individual fingers. This helps
   to indicate where extra practice may be useful to the user (see Jtypist
   which displays this as graphical bars, using color to indicate areas that
   need work).  A measure of typing rhythm would also be useful.

* Emulate other keyboard types.
   For example, Jtypist can pretend that you have a French, German, or Dvorak
   keyboard on the system even if you don't.  It will translate keypresses
   between keyboard types before checking them for correctness, and registering
   timings.  This work requires that the program should have keyboard layout
   maps available to it, and arises as a result of maintaining typing
   statistics by key and by finger (the program needs to know what key is
   operated by which finger).

LONG TERM

* While typing, graphically show the finger that is supposed to be used.

* Read lessons in the file formats of other free typing tutors
   (such as Jtypist)
