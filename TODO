THINGS TO DO for GNU Typist

See our latest TODO file at
http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=gtypist.git;a=blob_plain;f=TODO;hb=master

If you are interested in helping for some of the below items, we will
be glad to have you in the development team!

You can contact us by writing to bug-gtypist@gnu.org. Your suggestions
are welcome too!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

FOR 2.9 RELEASE

  * put the most current manual on the GNU.org webpage

  * check windows build one more time

  * Testing: need to test Y/N and R/N/E with utf8 and 8bit locales

FOR 2.9.1 RELEASE

  * fix (UTF-8 lessons in) MinGW port

  * beginner mode?

FOR 2.10 RELEASE

  * support multibyte encodings other than UTF8??

  * add a "beginner mode" which is enabled by default, and can be turned off
    by --expert/-x
    * this would explicitly show "return characters" (patch exists)
    * this would set -e 10
    * includes a help page that explains drills/speedtests, how to resize a
      terminal window, ...
    * how is that help page shown?
      * either we have a beginner.typ that is executed before gtypist.typ
        in beginner mode (requires switching of *.typ during runtime!), OR
      * we have special T:[BEGINNER] commands that are only executed in
        beginner mode

  * Show correct line numbers when nonexistent label was hit in the M command.

SHORT TERM

  * Show the label of the last exercise on exit (so that the user can
    easily return to it using -l). Currently, restarting at one of
    these labels won't set the banner, though.

  * Show a warning when caps lock is active

  * I'd like an option that only enabled wordwrapping.  The -w option does
    enable wordwrapping, but it also changes how paragraph breaks and
    spaces after periods are handled, which I don't want.
    Requested by Adam Olsen <rhamph@d2dc.net>

  * Make sure that all source files come with a suitable copyright
    statement (may be different with lessons?)

  * Make sure that the numpad's [ENTER] key is accepted in numpad
    lessons. (Reported by gherald@myway.com)

  * Another idea is to generate our lessons files directly in our
    format from spelling dictionaries, as they do in KTouch.

  * Reuse lessons from dvorak7min and possibly other typing tutors.

  * Replace 'getopt' by 'GNU gengetopt'

  * Improve the French translation of "lesson file", which includes
    both Drills (translated by "Exercice") and Speed tests ("Tests de
    vitesse").

  * Make a separate package for lessons, so that lessons compatible
    with a given gtypist version can be released without having to
    release the tool again.  This is already done by other packages:
    gimp plug-ins or TeTeX fonts are released separately.

    This is definitely need for this tool, for which tutorial files
    are at least as valuable as the raw program itself.

  * Provide a variant of the `n.typ' calculator keypad lesson, in
    which the `.' character is replaced by `,'. Useful for some
    european keyboards.

  * Add configuration file support. Should be very useful, in
    particular for teachers!

  * allow strings from a .typ file to be translated (things like
    "lesson: ")
  
  * Mac OS X Package? => there is already macports or similar!


  * Test wpemu option in combination with multibyte lessons

MEDIUM TERM

  * Windows installer, shortcuts for different lessons and manual?

  * Improve the interface by adding 2 interfaces:

    * Graphical interface (Probably GTK)

      The benefits we can expect from a GTK interface are:

      - Much attractive than the `ncurses' interface. 
      - Not using `ncurses' should avoid problems supporting different
        terminal types.
      - We could have a graphical control panel, to change settings
        that are so far only available in the command line (keyboard
        type, silent mode...)
      - Easy access to help and manual
      - Could still be compiled on Win32 on which GTK has been ported.
  
    * Audio interface

      Could use a system like Speech Dispatcher to read the lessons
      for visually impaired people or people living in very dense fog.

      We could also support audio typing exercises.  Users would type
      from a text read by a speaker.  Several audio files would be
      need, according to the language and the targeted typing speeded.
      That would be useful for people like secretaries and
      journalists.

      All this could be implemented in a clean way by implementing an
      event based mechanism. The core application could send interface
      messages to a generic interface manager, which could according
      to user settings, ask the graphical, text or audio interface to
      send it to the user.

      Specifications are on going. 

  * Add support for saving the last lesson (or part of a lesson) the
    user was working on, so the user can easily pick up where s/he
    left off.  (idea by Enrique Pedroso)

  * Improve the documentation of course files

  * Broaden our lesson database:

    - Create new lessons for other languages and keyboard types. 
    - Translate lessons in other languages (for languages that share
      the same keyboard, you can reuse instructions and drills)
    - We can also look for teachers who are ready to contribute
      lessons or let us reuse theirs...
    - Reuse lessons from old typing teaching books which copyrights
      have expired (how much time does it take?).
    - This will most likely require UTF-8 support

  * Better typing statistics.  Speed and accuracy for individual keys,
    and individual fingers. This helps to indicate where extra
    practice may be useful to the user (see Jtypist which displays
    this as graphical bars, using color to indicate areas that need
    work).  A measure of typing rhythm would also be useful.

  * Emulate other keyboard types.  For example, Jtypist can pretend
    that you have a French, German, or Dvorak keyboard on the system
    even if you don't.  It will translate keypresses between keyboard
    types before checking them for correctness, and registering
    timings.  This work requires that the program should have keyboard
    layout maps available to it, and arises as a result of maintaining
    typing statistics by key and by finger (the program needs to know
    what key is operated by which finger).

LONG TERM

  * While typing, graphically show the finger that is supposed to be used.

  * Read lessons in the file formats of other free typing tutors (such
    as Jtypist).
