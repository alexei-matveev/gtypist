GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
**************************

                         Version 2, June 1991

     Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
     
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
========

   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in
new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  1. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
     under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program",
     below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on
     the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under
     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
     translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
     included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each
     licensee is addressed as "you".

     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act
     of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
     Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
     the Program (independent of having been made by running the
     Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  2. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
     source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
     warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
     this License along with the Program.

     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
     for a fee.

  3. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

       a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

       b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
          in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program
          or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge
          to all third parties under the terms of this License.

       c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
          when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
          interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
          an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and
          a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
          provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the
          program under these conditions, and telling the user how to
          view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program
          itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
          announcement, your work based on the Program is not required
          to print an announcement.)

     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
     Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
     apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
     works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
     whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
     the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
     for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
     and every part regardless of who wrote it.

     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
     derivative or collective works based on the Program.

     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
     Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on
     a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
     other work under the scope of this License.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
     of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
     following:

       a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
          source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
          Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
          software interchange; or,

       b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
          years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
          cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
          machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
          distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
          medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

       c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
          to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
          allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
          received the program in object code or executable form with
          such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete
     source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
     plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
     used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
     However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
     not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
     source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
     kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable
     runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
     access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
     access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
     distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  6. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
     or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions
     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
     based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
     License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
     distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

  7. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
     subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any
     further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
     granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
     by third parties to this License.

  8. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
     Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
     royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
     receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only
     way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
     entirely from distribution of the Program.

     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
     intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
     in other circumstances.

     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
     any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
     the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
     willing to distribute software through any other system and a
     licensee cannot impose that choice.

     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
     to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  9. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
     the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
     this License.

 10. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such
     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
     to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
     the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
     version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program
     does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
     any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

 11. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
     author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted
     by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
     Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision
     will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
     all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
     and reuse of software generally.

                                NO WARRANTY

 12. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
     WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
     LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
     HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
     WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
     NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
     FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
     QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
     PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
     SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 13. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
     MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
     LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
     INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
     INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
     OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
     OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=============================================

   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND AN IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) 19YY  NAME OF AUTHOR
     
     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
     modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
     as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
     of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
     
     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU General Public License for more details.
     
     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
     Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like
this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19YY NAME OF AUTHOR
     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
     type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
     to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
     for details.

   The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program,
if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
     interest in the program `Gnomovision'
     (which makes passes at compilers) written
     by James Hacker.
     
     SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1989
     Ty Coon, President of Vice

   This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.

Introduction
************

   GNU Typist is an interactive typing tutor program. It uses an input
file to create a series of typing tutorials, drills, and speed tests. It
is intended to be used on raw terminals without graphics --it has been
compiled and used in GNU/Linux and Unix (Aix, Solaris) and also in
DOS/Windows (DOS 6.22, Windows 98, Windows NT).

   The program reads lessons written in an easy-to-learn scripting
language. It is distributed with several complete and good lessons, you
can use them, modify them or create new lessons (*note Script-file
commands::).

   If a script file is not specified on the command line, a default file
`gtypist.typ' will be used. (See details about the path in the section
*note Environment Variables::).

   The top line of the screen displays a banner. The bottom line of the
screen displays a message line, queries, and other status information.
The lines in between are used for the tutorials, drills, and speed
tests.

   There are two types of typing-exercises: drills and speed-tests.

   In a drill, gtypist displays text in every other line on the screen,
and waits for the user to correctly type the exact same text in the
intermediate lines.  Typing errors are indicated with an inverse `^',
or `>' if the character is a newline and at the end of the exercise it
calculates the real and effective rate in WPM.  If there were too many
errors, it will re-run the drill.  <Backspace> and <delete> are not
permitted in drills.

   In a speed test, gtypist displays text on the screen, and waits for
the user to correctly over-type the exact same text. It indicates typing
errors, and at the end of the test it calculates the real and effective
rate in WPM.  If there were too many errors, it will re-run the
speed-test.  <Backspace> and <delete> are recognised, but errors still
accumulate.

   If you already made too many mistakes, then you can use <ESC> to
give up and start again. Once you complete a lesson, you will be asked
whether you want to repeat it.

   There are also "practice only"-exercises (of both drills and
speed-tests) which you won't have to repeat at all. But we won't tell
you when this is the case, so you'll have to give your best anyway ;-)

   In typing speed reports, a 'word' is deemed to be five characters, so
the raw (gross) WPM is the number of characters in the test passage,
divided by five, then divided again by the number of minutes elapsed in
typing the passage. The adjusted WPM factors in the errors; each error
is counted as a word mistyped.

Invoking
********

   The syntax to invoke GNU Typist is:

   `gtypist [ Options... ] [ script_file ]'

   The supported options are given below (note that the long form is
supported only in GNU/Linux):

`-e, --error-max'
     Specifies the default maximum error percentage.  The default value
     is 3.0 and it must be between 0.0 and 100.0. There is a
     corresponding script-file command (*note Script-file commands::)
     which only overrides this if it is _stricter_ (smaller). This
     value is ignored for "practice only" drills.

`-n, --notimer'
     gtypist will display the typing speeds in WPM after both drills
     and speed tests. However, the lessons appear to be written for a
     program that only does this for speed tests. To make gtypist
     behave in a manner that matches the lessons, that is, to sup WPM
     reports on drills, use -n, -notimer.

`-t, --term-cursor'
     gtypist creates its own flashing block cursor on the screen, to
     help distinguish between the cursor and reverse video error
     indications.  Setting -t or -term_cursor suppresses this, and
     forces the program to use the terminal's cursor instead.

`-f, --curs-flash'
     The curs_flash value sets the block cursor flash period in tenths
     of a second. A value of 0 indicates no cursor flashing. The
     default is 10, and the maximum is 512. This option is ignored if
     -t or -term_cursor has been set.

`-c, --colo[u]rs'
     In normal operation, gtypist uses only normal and reverse video
     attributes in monochrome mode. This option may be used to specify
     the foreground and background colours on terminals that support
     colours.  The colours are specified as two integers, in the range
     0 to 7, separated by commas, setting the foreground and background
     colours. The colour codes 0 to 7 indicate black, red, green,
     yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, and white respectively. The default
     colours string is 7,0 - white on black. The option is ignored if
     the terminal does not support colours.

`-s, --silent'
     When gtypist detects a typing error, it will beep the terminal.
     Use this option to silence the beep.

`-q, --quiet'
     Same as -s, -silent.

`-w, --wpmode'
     With this option, gtypist will try to mimic a word processor in
     certain ways when executing an exercise. It will treat space at
     the end of a line as a correctly typed character, and word wrap.
     It will treat return at the end of a line as a signal to move to
     the start of the next paragraph if applicable. It will compress
     multiple spaces into a single space. And it will skip over hyphens
     found at the end of a line.

`-l, --start-label'
     Specifies the label in the script_file at which gtypist begins
     executing (see script files and commands below for information on
     labels). If start_label is not given, gtypist begins execution at
     the first line of the file.

You also have to set the environment variable `LANG' if you want to run
gtypist in your native language. *Note Environment Variables::.

   *Examples:*

To run the default lessons of lesson `gtypist.typ':
`gtypist'

To run the lesson in Spanish:
`gtypist esp.typ'

To instruct gtypist to look for lesson bar.typ in a non standard
directory `/home/foo':
`export GTYPIST_PATH="/home/foo"' `gtypist bar.typ'

To run the lessons in the file `test.typ' of directory `/tmp', starting
at label `TEST1', using the terminal's cursor, and running silently:
`gtypist -t -q -l TEST1 /tmp/test.typ'

Script-file commands
********************

   GNU Typist reads in the data for its typing lessons from a script
file.  With the exception of comments and blank lines, each line in the
file is of the format

   `command_char : command_data'

Here, `command_char' is a single character code that defines an action
for gtypist to take, and `command_data' is data for that command. If
`command_char' is a space character, this indicates that the line is a
continuation of the preceding non-space command. The ':' separator must
be in column two of the line.

   Comment lines are lines beginning with a '#' character, and are
ignored, as are blank lines. Comment lines may have any format provided
that they begin with '#'; other lines must have the above format.

   You should read the introduction so that you are familiar with the
basics: *Note Introduction::.

   The following is a list of valid `command_char' values:

`B'
     This command clears the complete screen. If any `command_data' is
     present, it is displayed in the one-line banner at the top of the
     screen, and remains in place until the next `B' command. This
     command may not be continued on the following line; it is a single
     line command.

`T'
     This presents a tutorial, and is a multi-line command, up to the
     limit of the screen length. Each line in the command is simply
     printed to the screen. This command clears the screen beneath the
     top banner line. After the display is done, the program waits
     before proceeding. This is also used to display menu-items.

`*'
     This indicates a label in the file. The label may be the target of
     a `G', `Y', `N' or `F' command. Labels may contain any character,
     including space, and are a single line command. Labels must be
     unique within lesson files. Whitespace at the end of labels is
     ignored.

`I'
     The I command can display some brief instructions above a drill or
     a speed test.  Only two lines or less are permitted.  Unlike the
     `T' command, it does not wait for any further keypresses before
     proceeding.  So it should really always be followed by an exercise.
     It clears the whole screen exercise area, so in this respect it's
     just like a two-line T.

`D,d'
     This command is called "drill", and it is one of two types of
     typing-exercises.

     It is a multi-line command. The text is displayed in every second
     line, and you type in the intermediate lines. Because of this, you
     cannot use more than 11 lines of drill-content.

     This type of exercise is supposed to be used for finger-training
     (i.e. jfjfjjf), but may also contain complete words and sentences
     if they are used to practice something (i.e. a
     letter/syllable/"grip"), and aren't real texts.

     The lowercase version `d' is a "practice only" drill - the user
     will not have not repeat this drill if he/she made too many
     mistakes.

`S,s'
     This is the second type of typing-exercise: the "speed test".

     It is a multi-line command.  It displays its text on the screen,
     and prompts the user to type on top of it.  That's why you can use
     up to 22 lines of text for one speed-test.  Backspace is
     recognised, but errors still accumulate.

     Speed-tests should be used for typing (mostly) complete sentences,
     texts or files (i.e. a letter, texinfo/html/tex files).

     The lowercase version `s' is a "practice only" speed-test - the
     user will not have not repeat this drill if he/she made too many
     mistakes.

`G'
     This causes gtypist to go to the label in `command_data', and
     continue execution of the script there. This is a single line
     command.

`Q'
     This command command prompts its text on the message line, and
     waits for a <Y> or an <N> before proceeding. Other characters are
     ignored.

     As a side effect, you can hit an fkey if it is bound (That's why
     this is used to set the prompt for menus).

`Y'
     This is like `G', except that the goto is executed only if the
     result of the last `Q' command was <Y>.

`N'
     This is like `G', except that the goto is executed only if the
     result of the last `Q' command was <N>.

`K'
     This binds a function key to a label. The format of the data line
     following this command must be `fkey_number:label', where
     `fkey_number' is a function key number in the range 1 to 12, and
     `label' is a label to go to when this key is pressed. A value of
     NULL for label removes any label binding from the key.

     If function keys are not available on the terminal other keys can
     be used: <1> to <9> to replace <F1> to <F9>, <0> to replace <F10>,
     <A> for <F11> and <S> for <F12>.

     Other alternatives for the keys <F1> to <F12> are the
     combinations: <Ctrl-Q>, <Ctrl-W>, <Ctrl-E>, <Ctrl-R>, <Ctrl-T>,
     <Ctrl-Z>, <Ctrl-U>, <Ctrl-I>, <Ctrl-O>, <Ctrl-P>, <Ctrl-A> and
     <Ctrl-S>.

     This is also useful where function keys are intercepted by other
     programs (for example by a window manager).

`E'
     This command is used to set the error-max value.  This is the
     highest error-rate permitted.

     If `--error-max/-e' is specified then this command will only have
     an effect if it is _stricter_ than the value specified on the
     command-line.

     `command_data' consists of the value (between 0.0 and 100.0),
     followed by '%' (this is required so that scripts are more
     readable).  A special value of `default' or `Default' sets the
     error-max value back to the default.

     Usually, this command only applies to the next drill, but you can
     make it persistent by putting a '*' at the end of `command_data'.

`F'
     This command ("set on-failure label") is used to set the label (in
     `command_data') where the user will skip to if he/she fails a
     drill.

     Usually, this command only applies to the next drill, but you can
     make it persistent by putting a '*' at the end of `command_data'.

     If label is NULL then this resets the label.

`X'
     This command causes gtypist to exit. It is a single line command.
     Any `command_data' is ignored. The program also exits if the end
     of the file is found (so you could also place a label there and
     just `G' to it)

   Here is a tiny example script to demonstrate the available commands
(`tinydemo.typ' lesson file):

How to contribute new lessons

   Here are some hints how you can quickly create new lessons.

File: gtypist.info,  Node: Ktouch-lessons,  Prev: Create drills from fortune,  Up: How to contribute new lessons

Ktouch-lessons
==============

   A very easy way to write lessons is to write them in the format that
`ktouch' uses, and then convert it to a gtypist lesson using
`tools/ktouch2typ.pl'. This will take care of writing some loops,
"jump-tables" and a menu.

   The ktouch-format consists only of lessons, which are preceded by
their names, and separated by blank lines and/or comments (# at the
beginning of the line). So the first non-blank, non-comment line in the
file is the name of the first lesson, and the first lesson consists of
all the lines up to the next comment or blank line. After the separator
(comment or blank line) the name of the second lesson follows and so on.

   This is an example of a three-lesson ktouch-file (excerpts from the
first three lessons of german.ktouch):
     #

     das dass lös fad dass lös als dass las lös fad dass als dass dass
     ded ded ded dej dek del deö ded deö del dek dej ded dej dek delde

   Once you are done, use `tools/ktouch2typ.pl' to convert the file:
`ktouch2typ.pl lesson.ktouch' converts `lesson.ktouch' to `lesson.typ'.
It is important that the input-file ends in ".ktouch", otherwise
`ktouch2typ.pl' will skip it. Warning: this will overwrite `lesson.typ'
without asking you !

   You can customize the number of lines that `ktouch2typ.pl' uses for
each drill by modifying the relevant variable in `tools/ktouch2typ.pl'.

   Obviously, the disadvantage of this is that you cannot make use of
all of gtypist's features. On the other hand, the output-file is very
readable, so you can edit it to use more of gtypist's features.

Create drills from fortune
==========================

   Using `gtypist-mode.el' you can quickly create lessons with text
from the program `fortune' (or the emacs-internal `yow' if `fortune'
isn't available, as is the case on windows).

   Besides being used for creating new lessons, this command can be used
to quickly create new drills for you to practice with.

   Once you installed `gtypist-mode.el' (*note Emacs mode for editing
gtypist-lessons::), you can open a file with ".typ" extension and run
`C-c C-f' to create a drill (`O:' by default, use `C-u' or `C-u C-u'
prefix to change).


File: gtypist.info,  Node: Emacs mode for editing gtypist-lessons,  Next: Technical Information,  Prev: How to contribute new lessons,  Up: Top

Emacs mode for editing gtypist-lessons
**************************************

   gtypist now comes with an Emacs major-mode which does
syntax-highlighting, indentation and has some convenience commands for
counting labels, a goto-label-command, inserting properly centered
banners, special comments and a bit more.

   Copy this file from `tools/gtypist-mode.el' (or
`/usr/share/doc/gtypist' if you are using the debian package) to
wherever you put your local elisp-files (e.g. `~/elisp') and put this
in your `~/.emacs' (adapt path!):

     (autoload 'gtypist-mode "~/elisp/gtypist-mode")

   or put it in `load-path' (`make install' in the sources should take
care of this for GNU Emacs) and use this instead:

     (autoload 'gtypist-mode "gtypist-mode")

   *and* add this to your `~/.emacs':

     (setq auto-mode-alist
           (cons '("\\.typ\\'" . gtypist-mode) auto-mode-alist))

Here are the commands along with the keybindings:

`C-c C-i, M-x gtypist-mode-info'
     This shows gtypist's texinfo-documentation, starting at node
     "Script-file commands" (*note Script-file commands::). With prefix,
     start at the top-node.

`C-c C-g, M-x gtypist-mode-goto-label'
     Query for a label to go to (with completion).

`C-c C-l, M-x gtypist-mode-next-label'
     This command inserts the next label in a numbered sequence of
     labels.  For example, if you insert
          *:SERIES1_L1
     and hit `C-c C-l' then gtypist-mode will insert
          *:SERIES1_L2

`C-c C-b, M-x gtypist-mode-insert-banner'
     This command inserts a centered `B:' command. It's centered on 66
     columns because "gtypist <version>" is in the right corner
     (prompts for content).

`C-c C-r, M-x gtypist-mode-insert-hrule'
     Inserts a horizontal rule (comment) consisting of dashes.

`C-c C-n, M-x gtypist-mode-new-lesson'
     Insert the comments (header) and a label to start a new lesson
     (prompts for name).

`C-c C-f, M-x gtypist-mode-fortune-to-drill'
     Insert a drill (`D:') with text from `fortune' (or `yow' if
     `fortune' isn't available). Use `C-u' prefix to get `S:', and `C-u
     C-u' to get `d:'.

Run `C-h m' for a complete list of commands and their keybindings.

   If you find bugs or if you think there's something else this mode
could do, please write to <bug-gtypist@gnu.org>.

* Menu:

* Environment Variables::
* Errors and omissions::


File: gtypist.info,  Node: Environment Variables,  Next: Errors and omissions,  Prev: Technical Information,  Up: Technical Information

Environment Variables
=====================

   GNU Typist uses the following environment variables:

`LANG'
     Typist offers Native Language Support (NLS) with support of the
     gettext library, this means that if your system supports it, the
     language of the messages shown by gtypist can be chosen. By now
     gtypist is distributed with messages in English, Spanish and
     German. To use a particular NLS use the environment variable LANG
     and set it to the appropriate 'LL_CC' combination where 'LL' is an
     ISO 639 two-letter language code and 'CC' is an ISO 3166
     two-letter country code (i.e. 'es_ES' for Spain and 'de_DE' for
     Germany). In some systems it will be also necessary to set the
     environment variable LANGUAGE to the same value.

     If you want to translate messages to a different language (or if
     you want to correct a message), please communicate it to
     <bug-gtypist@gnu.org>.

`GTYPIST_PATH'
     Lists the directories that the program will look in for script
     files.  It has the standard format for paths, that is, a list of
     directories separated by ':'s. To open a script, gtypist will try
     the following paths: (1) to use the script name alone (2) it will
     append each one of the directories specified in the variable
     `GTYPIST_PATH' and (3) it will append the directory used during
     the installation process (e.g.  `/usr/local/share/gtypist' or
     `/usr/share/gtypist').

`TERM'
     Used by curses to manage the display.

`TERMINFO'
     This may need to be set if the path to the `terminfo' database is
     different between the system the binary was compiled on and the
     one it is being run on. For example, in older Slackware systems,
     the terminfo database resides in `/usr/lib/terminfo'. On RedHat
     Linux, it is in `/usr/share/terminfo'. If the program complains
     about the terminal type, and the value of `TERM' is correct, check
     into this.


File: gtypist.info,  Node: Errors and omissions,  Prev: Environment Variables,  Up: Technical Information

Errors and omissions
====================

   GNU Typist does not go to much effort to minimize terminal output. In
particular, the flashing block cursor can cause a lot of cursor
movement. Using the terminal's own cursor will help if this becomes a
problem.

   In speed tests, the program does not allow backspacing or deletion
past the beginning of the screen line, or back through Tab characters.
This is purely to simplify screen updating.

   Colour curses modes do not seem to work well with UnixWare. In
particular, reverse video is not always rendered correctly on some
terminal types, and xterms.

History of GNU Typist
*********************

   * The initial program was written for VAX/VMS BASIC by someone at
     Harris Corp (Ft. Lauderdale, FL).

   * D. Jason Penney <penneyj@slc.com> rewrote it for Microsoft BASICA

   * D. Jason Penney <penneyj@slc.com> rewrote it in C and the curses
     library

   * Simon Baldwin <simonb@sco.com> rewrote the version of D. Jason
     Penney, his innovations are described in the NEWS file (versions
     2.2 to 2.2b).  He is the holder of the copyright for GNU Typist
     (that is distributed under the GPL).  Simon also wrote a version
     of Typist in Java that initially he called JTypist but that now is
     called Typist:

     <http://www.ocston.org/~simonb/typist/>

   * Since 1997, Ben Armstrong <synrg@sanctuary.nslug.ns.ca> has helped
     by fixing bugs and maintaining a Debian package (see
     <http://packages.debian.org/gtypist>).

   * In 2000, Vladimir Támara <vtamara@users.sourceforge.net> and Igor
     Támara <ikks@users.sourceforge.net> became the maintainers of the
     C version. Before Nov/2000, GNU Typist was maintained as part of
     the project Structio.  <http://structio.sourceforge.net>

   * November 2000, accepted as a GNU package! Renamed to GNU Typist (or
     gtypist).

   * In May 2001, Michael Opdenacker <michaelo@gnu.org>, who learned
     touch typing with GNU Typist, became the new maintainer. Project
     development is now hosted on
     <http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gtypist/>.
