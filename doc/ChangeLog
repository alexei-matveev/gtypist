	* gtypist.texi: fixed to include the original fdl.texi file.
	* gtypist.texi: changes to let makeinfo use the best output
	in supported formats, as recommended in the texinfo manual:
	Replaced all @url calls by @uref (@url doesn't create http links
	in the makeinfo html output; I was using texi2html to create
	the html manual, but only makeinfo should be used). 
	Replaced 'Name @email{address}' by '@mail{address, Name}.
	Used @option everywhere for command line options.
	Used @samp to introduce single characters.
        Small fixes to use texinfo commands when needed.
	* gtypist.texi: updated Felix Natter's email address.

2002-04-08  Michael Opdenacker  <michaelo@gnu.org>

	* gtypist.texi: uses the new @copying command provided by texinfo-4.2.
	The manual is now released under the GNU Free Documentation license
	(with no Invariant Sections) which is now included in the manual.
	
2002-04-07  Michael Opdenacker  <michaelo@gnu.org>

	* gtypist.cz.texi: Czech translation of the manual
	from Hynek Hanke <hanke@volny.cz>

2002-02-23  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* gtypist.texi (Emacs mode): do not mention that C-c C-f can be used
	to quickly create lesson for oneself to practice with (That will
	be typefortune's purpose)
	* gtypist.texi: put node Script file commands after Supplied lessons
	(swap Supplied lessons and Script file commands)
	to make the order more logical

2002-01-19  Michael Opdenacker <michaelo@gnu.org>

	* gtypist.texi: Added French to the list of interface languages.
	Recommended to use a wider terminal for languages such as French.

2001-11-03  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* gtypist.texi (many nodes): changed the node-names to be shorter
	and add descriptions in the menus
	(i.e. Emacs mode for editing gtypist scripts => Emacs mode)
	* gtypist.texi (Technical Information): remove this node, because
	it contains two subnodes that are completely unrelated (Environment
	Variables and Known bugs); put the two subnodes in the toplevel
	menu instead
	* gtypist.texi (Distribution): use @asis instead of @emph because
	@emph results in "_Primary distribution site_"

2001-10-20  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* gtypist.texi: fix some TODO's
	* gtypist.texi: rename node "Emacs mode for editing gtypist lessons" to

2001-08-22  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* gtypist.texi (Introduction): as Kevin Gallagher <kevingal@onramp.net>
	(and Eli Zaretskii <eliz@is.elta.co.il>) suggested, do not mention
	<backspace> and <delete> explicitly (because <delete> leads to
	confusion). Instead, just mention ("Backward deleting")

2001-08-16  Michael Opdenacker 	<michaelo@gnu.org>
