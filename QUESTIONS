Questions asked by Brave GNU World 
----------------------------------

 * What is it?

   GNU Typist is a typing tutor. You can learn correct
   typing with it and improve your skills by practicing
   its exercises on a regular basis.

 * Who would use it?

   - Individuals who want to improve their typing skills.
   - Educational institutions for their typing course
     exercises.

 * Why would they use it instead of similar projects?

   This is mainly thanks to the GNU General Public license under which
   is it released. I won't discuss all the interests of Free Software,
   but here are the major ones I see for this tool...

   - For individuals: 

     o The program is freely available, and is already
       installed in some GNU systems (such as Debian GNU / Linux)

     o The program is been made by people using it, or according to the
       needs expressed by users. 

     o They can participate in improving the tool quality, by reporting bugs
       and even propose improvements to the source code.

   - For educational institutions, in addition to the above reasons:

     o They can rely on the availability of this software, as nobody
       can restrict their freedom to use it for their educational programs.
       
       Freeware typing programs are available at the moment, but their
       owners can discontinue their distribution or their support without
       any notice. You can't base your educational programs on such software. 

       More generally, with proprietary software, you have no way to make sure 
       that the software satisfies your needs. You depend one somebody else's
       good will.

       Using Free Software gives you freedom to modify the programs
       according to your needs, or pay someone to do that. 

     o Teachers will be able to rely on the course library delivered
       with the software. As the lesson file format is simple, they
       can easily write their own lessons (possibly from exercises they
       have already written) 

       This is a way of encouraging schools to share their
       teaching materials and support education in developing countries,
       who may neither have enough teachers nor funds to acquire proprietary
       courses. 

 * (Programming) language used in this project?

   - C language. Compliant with GNU coding standards

 * Special features/strengths?

   - Available in several versions of Unix (including GNU/Linux) and Windows.
   - It's extensible... lessons for other keyboards and languages
     can be easily added.

 * Special problems?

   - May be tough to continue to support Win32 when new features such as
     a GTK graphical interface or speech synthesis is implemented,
     because of the lack of support of the new libraries to be used.
     However, free operating systems are prioritary.

 * Who is working on it?

   o Ben Armstrong, Debian package maintainer  
   o Rob Mars, development
   o Felix Natter, development, German translation
   o Dmitry Rutsky, development, Russian translation 
   o Paul Goins, development, current project maintainer

   ... and lots of other contributors are listed in the `ChangeLog'
    and `THANKS' files.

 * History of the project?

   - See the manual (http://www.gnu.org/software/gtypist/doc/gtypist.html)
     for the complete history of this project. It started on VAX/VMS! 

 * Plans for the close and distant future?

   - See the http://www.gnu.org/software/gtypist/TODO.txt file.
     It is a copy of the TODO file in the project sources.  

 * Do you need help? If so: of what kind?

   Yes, we need help!

   - For supporting other languages in the interface.
   - For coding and testing, or getting patches for today's code.
   - For finding people (teachers, for example), who would write
     new lessons.
   - For finding old typing lessons in libraries, which copyrights
     have expired (how long does it take for a copyright on
     a written document to expire?). Once we have written lesson
     files in the GNU Typist format from these old documents,
     I guess there is no problem to copyleft these new files
     under the GPL.

 * Interesting/fun stories that might juice up the story?

   - Nothing yet.

 * Website/FTP addresses?

   - All the online resources are documented at http://www.gnu.org/software/gtypist/

 * License?!

   - The GNU General Public License, for the software and all the files
     included in its source tarball. It is copyrighted directly by the Free Software
     Foundation.

   - All the contributions to be added to the source tarball
     (typically lesson files) must thus be released with the same license 
     and copyright.
   
 * Standard documents to read in this context?

   - Nothing yet.

 * Anything you would like to see mentioned?

   - Nothing yet.

 * Answer to a question I forgot?
 
   - Who shall I send my comments to?

     o Your comments are all welcome! Please, send them to bug-gtypist@gnu.org
